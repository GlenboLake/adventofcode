# Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is a Christmas-themed programming challenge that has occurred every year since 2015. It is comprised of one two-part puzzle for each day, starting December 1, and ending on Christmas. These are my solutions to the first three years.

[2015 solutions](/2015) are written in Scala and were how I taught myself the language. The other years are written in Python.
